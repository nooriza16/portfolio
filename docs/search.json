(2025)’smethodology on UK’s nutritional-based obesity research, as RF and XGB excel withhigh-dimensional, non-linearity, and predictive performance.

    "section": "Result",
    "text": "Result\n1) Preliminary Result\n\nThe results highlight differences in model performance and generalization: Linear Regression generalizes well, but its predictive power is limited by the linearity assumption, which some features violate, as shown in the correlation matrix While Random Forest and XGBoost fit the training data well, they overfit on the test data. Despite this, they outperform Linear Regression in RMSE, with Random Forest performing better than XGBoost.’\n2) Hyperparameter tuning and Cross Validation result\nAs Linear Regression does not have hyperparameters to tune, hyperparameters tuning will be applied to RF and XGB. GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation is used to optimize performance, aiming to reduce test RMSE and improve R² while maintaining simplicity and efficiency.\n\nRandom Forest\nIn RF, the model’s previous overfitting result suggest that the tree might be too deep, thus max_depth is tested from shallow (3) to moderately deep (12), aiming to capture key patterns without fitting irrelevant details. The min_samples_split and min_samples_leaf is also tuned (up to 15) to prevent overly specific splits. Additionally, n_estimator is optimized, as more trees can improve performance.\n\nThe model reduces overfitting, boosts R² on test data, and sets max_depth to 5 for better generalization. We will examine this hyperparameter individually using validation curve to identify the point at which increasing it leads to overfitting.\n\nWe can see that after max_depth = 5 on validation curve (red), model’s performance on unseen data plateaus, indicating that beyond this point the model likely starting to overfit.\nXGBoost\nIn XGBoost, to optimize model performance, we will vary max_depth to find an optimal depth. The learning_rate will be evaluate to achieve stable adjusted parameter after being iterated. We will also vary n_estimators , as the bigger the number the more stable the model performance. Additionally, reg_lambda will be tested to reduce overfitting by penalize large weights.\n\nAfter tuning, R² increases, overfitting reduced significantly, and the model identifies a max_depth of 4 for good generalization. We will investigate this using a validation curve.\n\nDespite its slightly fluctuative R² score, the pleateu starts to emerge from the max_depth = 4, suggesting that changing the hyperparameter within that range doesn’t significantly improve generalization performance and may increase the risk of overfitting.\n\n3) Comparison of Each Model\n\n\nThe accuracy of machine learning models in predicting pre-teen obesity prevalence in London using early life adversities varies. Random Forest and XGBoost models show higher R² and lower RMSE compared to the baseline linear regression model. Among advanced models, RF has a better performance than XGBoost, with higher R² (0.622 vs. 0.603), with relatively small prediction errors compared to other models listed (0.0334 vs. 0.0342 and 0.0354), and less overfitting before and after hyperparameter tuning.\nAdditionally, Random Forest is faster than XGBoost, even with larger folds. However, even with advanced models like Random Forest, early life adversities can only explain 62.2% of the variance in pre-teen obesity prevalence in London. This leaves 37.8% unexplained. This happened as early life adversity associated with central adiposity in 2 ways, a physiological route (metabolic functioning) and psychosocial route (behaviour) (Davis et al., 2014). Meanwhile, the dataset used in this study does not include physiological aspects, only linking potential proxies for psychosocial, which may account for the unexplained variance.\nTo address RQ2, we will compare feature contributions in the top models, Random Forest and XGBoost, using a SHAP beeswarm plot.\n\n\nThe Random Forest and XGBoost models consistently highlight child poverty, lackof educational qualifications, and mental health index as key contributing factors topre-teen obesity prevalence, underscoring their universal importance. This alignswith Kimbro and Denney ( 2013) which linked obesity with higher poverty level andlow education.\nThe third-ranked mental health index further emphasizes the needfor integrating mental health to obesity interventions. The models diverge in their fourth and fifth rankings: RF places families with 3+children fourth and those working 49+ hours per week fifth, while XGB ranksworking 49+ hours fourth and lone parent unemployment fifth. RF highlightsresource strain in larger households and time strain potentially limiting healthymeal preparation or child supervision, while XGB points to struggles in single-parent households and overtime working (49+ hours exceeds the UK Working TimeDirective).\nThese findings suggests that obesity interventions may benefit from incorporatingat-risk populations with childhood adversities, as well as evaluating supportschemes for work-life balance, unemployed single parents, and large households"

The movement will cost bathers energy, thus energy will be updated every ticks with detail as follows:\n\nneck area, each patches cost 4 to 7 energy\nhead, each patches costs 4 to 5 energy\nIn non-rip currents area near the shoreline, each patch will cost 2 energy\nIn non-rip currents area away from the shoreline cost 3 energy\n\nAfter that, when the response time set, the ship will navigate its direction depending on target availability in radius of 5 patch either move randomly or to rescue. Upon sensing the target, the ship will move forward faster of 5 patch else it moves 2 patches. After that, when the ship is near enough (radius 3) with the bathers it will rescue, by turning the bathers into pink, and trigger rescued counter. At the same time, in other location bathers which energy depleted will trigger drown counter and bathers hit the right edge will trigger lost counter."
